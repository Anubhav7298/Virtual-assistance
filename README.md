# Virtual Assistant Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend code for a virtual assistant project. The virtual assistant is designed to perform tasks based on voice commands and includes functionalities such as speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and web browsing. This backend leverages Python libraries to process voice input and execute various commands.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts text responses into spoken words using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Web Browsing**: Executes web browser commands to open URLs using the `webbrowser` library.

## Libraries Used

- **`speech_recognition`**: For recognizing and processing speech input.
- **`pyttsx3`**: For converting text to speech.
- **`webbrowser`**: For opening URLs in a web browser.
